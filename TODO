- Create Repo
- Update README.md with example
- Create an example app
- defer AI loading
- Auto Track Page Views
- setup window.onerror automatically
- expose an ErrorHandler
- if app is not loaded yet, put items in a queue. (is this handled by AI-JS?)


- NGRX Extension? (maybe create an Issue)
- Schematics? (maybe create an Issue)
